*** CV-DATA-SPLITTER ***

Package for generating datasets for cross-validation purposes.

Learning parameters of a prediction function is a major objective. In order
to avoid over-fitting, the model is trained on a different data sample 
(the 'training set') and evaluated out-of-sample on a so called 'test set'.
This approach is known as cross-validation (CV).

This package comprises different approaches of dividing the raw data set into
a training and test set, respectively, depending on the nature of the
underlying data.

An nice overview can be accessed here:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html

The separated data sets are stored in array of matrices, which can be read-in
for the original model training and evaluation.

Public Function:
================
CvDataSplitter()

Parameters:
===========
The user needs to pass a bundle in pointer form to the function
CvDataSplitter() which includes at least:
(i) A list named 'X' with k series, or a matrix named 'X' with T rows
and k columns.
In case a matrix 'X' was passed, the user additionally needs to pass
(ii) a column vector named 'index' refering to the T observations (can
be easily generated via gretl by 'genr index').

Additionally, the user can optionally specify the following 2 parameters:
cv_type		-- string, Type of cross-validation (CV):
		(i) 'kfold' (default),
		(ii) 'loo' (Leave-One-Out)
		(iii) 'recwin' (recursive window for time-series (TS) data)
		(iv) 'rolwin' (rolling window using a fixed window-width
		for TS data)

n_folds		-- int, divide sample into n_folds of groups of equal
		size (can only be set for cv_type='kfold' (default 5);
		otherwise determined by the respective CV procedure)

win_size	-- int, (Initial) Window-width for moving-window related
		methods 'rolwin' and 'recwin' (default 25 pct. of total
		valid observations)

Returns:
=========
The function returns the following information to the bundle:
X_train		-- array of 'n_folds' matrices, each matrix is of dimension
		T(i) by (1+k) (for i=1,2,...) holding the observation
		index in the 1st column and the training data for k
		variables across columns.
X_test		-- array of 'n_folds' matrices, each matrix is of dimension
		T(j) by (1+k) (j=1,2,...) holding the observation index in the
		1st column and the test data for k variables across columns.
